# Mic2Seed
### This version has been customized to work with the AnuBitux distro, please refer to the main branch if you want to use the tool in other environments.
An easy to use python script that collects entropy through the microphone and generates a BIP39 mnemonic seed.

### Installation
Install git, python3 and pip (if needed):
```
sudo apt install git python3 python3-pip
```
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/ASeriousMister/Mic2Seed
```
Move to the tool's directory
```
cd /path/Mic2Seed
```
Install requirements (read above for Python virtual envitonments):
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
There may be some dependency problems, if so try installing portaudio19-dev with
```
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
```
then install requirements again with
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the tool:
```
python3 mic2seed.py
```

### Utilization
User simply has to start the tool and wait until it collects entropy.
At the end, the tool will show a 24 words BIP39 mnemonic seed, that may be used with many different software wallets.

### Optional: using Virtual Environment
Install python virtual environments
```
pip3 install virtualenv
```
Now move to DiceTracker.py's directory,
```
cd Mic2Seed
```
create a virtual environment (in the example named dtve, but you can choose your preferred name)
```
virtualenv msve
```
and activate it
```
source msve/bin/activate
```
The name of the virtual enviroment should appear, in brackets, on the left of your command line.
